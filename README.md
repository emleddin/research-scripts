# research-scripts

This repository contains examples of the different run and analysis scripts
described in the research guides.

See [comp-chem-website](https://github.com/emleddin/comp-chem-website) for explanations.

The majority of these scripts pertain to molecular dynamics (MD), though
there are some for quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM).

## LICHEM-tools
This directory contains a number of scripts for working with
[LICHEM](https://github.com/CisnerosResearch/LICHEM).

## QOL-Improvements
This directory contains a number of random scripts that help make life easier.

## amber-analysis
This directory contains different scripts relevant to analyzing AMBER MD
simulations.

## amber-setup
This directory contains a collection of scripts for preparing systems and
running simulations with AMBER MD.

## gromacs-setup
This directory contains scripts to help prepare and run GROMACS simulations
using AMBER force fields.

## other-programs
This directory contains different scripts and configuration files relevant to
programs outside of those used for MD or QM/MM.
Currently, it contains information for CAVER, gnuplot, and VMD.

## tinker-analysis
This directory contains different scripts relevant to analyzing TINKER MD
simulations.

## tinker-params
This directory contains information on building a `tinker.key` file from an
AMBER prmtop file.
