## `image-conversion.txt`

This file contains example `bash` commands for converting all the `.eps` files
in a directory to `.pdf` or `.png`.

## `residuenumbers.sh`

A `bash` script for writing out the residue numbers used by biologists so
that they can be "keyed" to the ones in the AMBER PDB file that starts at 1.
The example here had a gap in the biologist numbering (due to the actual
residues not being crystallized), which is why it is broken up.
