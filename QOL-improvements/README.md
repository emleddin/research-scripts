This directory contains a number of random scripts that help make life easier.

## `base.bashrc`

This file contains some commands that I like to use in my `.bashrc` files.

## `image-conversion.txt`

This file contains example `bash` commands for converting all the `.eps` files
in a directory to `.pdf` or `.png`.

This file is a `bash` script for making a prettier output from `qstat` on a
PBS queuing system.
