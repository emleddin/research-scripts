## `.gnuplot`
A configuration file for `gnuplot` with a `colorsequence` based off of `podo`.
This should be saved as `~/.gnuplot`.

## `.vmdrc`
My configuration file for `VMD` with things such as using black for labels.
This should be saved as `~/.vmdrc`.

## `midasrc`
A configuration file for `UCSF Chimera` (which, in my experience, is applied
after opening Chimera's command line). This should be stored as
`~/.chimera/midasrc`.

## `run-caver.sh`
This is a script for running the command-line [CAVER](http://www.caver.cz/)
from multiple starting point residues in the same protein.
