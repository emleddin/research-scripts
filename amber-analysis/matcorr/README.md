# Matrix Correlation
These scripts pertain to matrix correlation analysis (instances of correlation,
anti-correlation, and no correlation between residues).

## `matrcorr_graph.py`
This script generates a residue-by-residue heat map of correlation and
anti-correlation.
It first reads in the data files generated by cpptraj.
Next, it saves differences in those values.
Then it creates plots of individual data against itself.
Finally it plots differences between two datasets.
You can tell it to use a custom diverging colormap.

Mark has written a [version](https://github.com/markahix/Basic-Scripts/blob/master/cpptraj_plots/Corr_Decomp_Analysis.py)
that accounts for more than magnitude changes (anti to corr and corr to anti).

## `matcor-chimera-numbers.sh`
This script creates the attribute list for plotting matrix correlation
information with Chimera.
